# Grokking Algorithms Study Repository

This repository contains my study notes and code implementations based on the book **"Grokking Algorithms"** by Aditya Y. Bhargava.

## Overview

This project is a collection of my progress and understanding of the concepts introduced in the book. I aim to cover each chapter, providing summaries, code implementations, and additional notes.

## Progress

- [x] Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms
- [x] Chapter 2: Selection Sort
- [x] Chapter 3: Recursion
- [x] Chapter 4: Quicksort

## Contents

### Chapter X: Title
- Each chapter has a folder within the repository.
- A markdown file named after the chapter contains notes and summaries.
- Each Python file contains implementations related to sections of the chapter.

<!-- Add new sections for each chapter as you progress -->
